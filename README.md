# Recommendations_with_IBM
Project No.5 in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. Design a Recommendation Engine with IBM Watson. BM has an online data science community where members can post tutorials, notebooks, articles, and datasets. In this project, you will build a recommendation engine, based on user behavior and socialnetwork in IBM Watson Studioâ€™s data platform, to surface content most likely to be relevant to a user.In this assignment, we will be putting our recommendation skills to use on real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. 


## Introduction

For this project we will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles we think they will like. Below you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform.

Though the above dashboard is just showing the newest articles, you could imagine having a recommendation board available here that shows the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, you will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. You can create your own account to become a part of their community, and get a better understanding of their data by creating an account on the platform here.
